Final Project for Fall 2025 CIS1051. 
Python version of the iPhone game, Music Square. With the help of a youtube tutorial made by CodeCC, I was able to code something similar to the game but I made my own revisions. 
The music in the background is made using Online Sequencer and is Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up". 

This project was very time consuming but not too difficult as I had the youtube video to help me code. What was difficult was adjusting CodeCC's code to make it my own and still making it work.
There were certain times where one change I made completely crashed the code and then I had to do major google searches to figure out what went wrong. Eventually I was able to figure it out.
Another difficulty was making the music, originally I had it just be an mp3 of "Never Gonna Give You Up" instrumental instead and that cause the image to move around not to the beat and it just looked messy. 
That is why I decided to make a version on Online Sequencer, which was extremely difficult because I had to figure how to turn the song to a piano version. 

We are interested in what challenges you encountered in coding and if you found a way to overcome them or go around them.

We understand that it may not be possible to complete your original vision;  we are interested in how you responded in the face of adversity.  We are interested in the journey, not the destination.
