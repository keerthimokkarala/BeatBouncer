Final Project for Fall 2025 CIS1051. 

Python version of the iPhone game, Music Square. With the help of a youtube tutorial made by CodeCC, I was able to code something similar to the game but I made my own revisions. 
The music in the background is made using Online Sequencer and is Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up". 

This project was very time consuming but not too difficult as I had the youtube video to help me code. What was difficult was adjusting CodeCC's code to make it my own and still making it work.
There were certain times where one change I made completely crashed the code and then I had to do a ton google searches to figure out what went wrong. Eventually I was able to figure it out. With the help of a friend, they taught me how to make the explosion animation and I figured out how to make it an image explode instead of a shape. 

Another difficulty was making the music, originally I had it just be an mp3 of "Never Gonna Give You Up" instrumental instead and that cause the image to move around not to the beat and it just looked messy. 
That is why I decided to make a version on Online Sequencer, which was extremely difficult because I had to figure how to turn the song to a piano version. 

This is pretty similar to what I wanted the final product to look like. I did want it to be more game like and have the image bouncing around in an actual map, but I decided against it and instead decided to make the image hit other images and make them "explode". This suggestion was made by my TA, shoutout it made the project 10x funnier. Also I originally started out by making this using Turtle and while it did bounce around in a square, I found it difficult to make it similar my vision of it being a map and moving around. So while I was unsure what to do, after some YouTube searches, that's when I found CodeCC's video and I followed along.
